# DevOps Dynamo Project

Welcome to the DevOps Dynamo Project Overview! In this document, I will provide a summary of a comprehensive DevOps project I have recently completed. This project encompasses various tools and practices to enhance the software development, deployment, and monitoring processes.

## Project Scope

The primary objective of this project was to establish a robust DevOps pipeline while automating infrastructure provisioning and optimizing development workflows. Below, I will outline the key components and highlights of this project.

### Infrastructure and Environment

- **Terraform for Infrastructure**: Leveraged Terraform to automate the setup of cloud resources, networks, and security configurations.

- **Jenkins Controller**: Created a Jenkins controller instance to centralize CI/CD pipelines management.

- **Build Node**: Provisioned a dedicated build node to build and test application code.

- **Ansible for Configuration**: Utilized Ansible for automated configuration management tasks across the infrastructure.

### CI/CD Pipeline Automation

- **Jenkins and Ansible Integration**: Configured Jenkins controller and build node using Ansible playbooks to ensure consistent environments.

- **Jenkins Pipeline Setup**: Defined Jenkins pipeline jobs for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

- **Jenkinsfile Creation**: Crafted Jenkinsfiles from scratch to define customized pipeline stages.

- **Multibranch Pipeline**: Implemented a multibranch pipeline for continuous integration across various code branches.

- **GitHub Webhook Integration**: Enabled GitHub webhooks to trigger automated builds and deployments upon code changes.

### Code Quality and Security

- **SonarQube Integration**: Integrated SonarQube for code quality analysis and adherence to coding standards.

- **Sonar Scanner Execution**: Executed the SonarQube scanner to assess code quality and security.

- **Custom SonarQube Rules**: Defined custom rules and gates within SonarQube to enforce coding standards and security practices.

- **SonarQube Callbacks**: Set up callback rules to notify development teams of code quality issues.
